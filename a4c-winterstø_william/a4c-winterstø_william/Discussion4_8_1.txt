Write a short reflection on the software engineering aspects of this extension in the two
metalanguages. (I interpret this as discussing things like code quality)

- The extentions was easy to make thanks to good code quality and easy to expand code.
I just added an extra two lines in the abstract syntax and expanded the eval statement
with their own evaluation. Both metalanguages are written like this to allow easy expansion
of new features.
